## **raw** mode

In **raw** mode, you don't require the opposite faction players also installing **DLT**. **DLT** translates your English into their language (Common or Orcish). So you can talk to them, but they are unable to reply you, cause you cannot understand their language. (DLT cannot translate their language back into your language)

The picture below describes what each kind of player see:

## **b256** mode

In **b256** mode, you require the opposite faction players also have **DLT** installed. In this mode, you can fully understand each other. You can even speak other languages like Chinese and Japanese.
